Hi my Name is TGTDK

In twilight's gentle, golden hue,
Where dreams unfold, and skies are true,
A whispered breeze through leaves it weaves,
A tale of hope, that heart believes.

The moon, a guide, in the velvet night,
Casting shadows, soft and light,
Stars like diamonds, they shimmer and gleam,
A celestial ballet, a cosmic dream.

On fields of green, where wildflowers sway,
Nature's canvas in the light of day,
A symphony of colors, a vibrant trance,
A dance of life, a sweet romance.

Through life's journey, where rivers wind,
Stories of courage, and love entwined,
Mountains stand with peaks so high,
A testament to dreams that touch the sky.

In every moment, a poem unfolds,
In whispers of the wind, in stories untold,
Let the rhythm of life, your heart compose,
A symphony of verses, where happiness grows.
